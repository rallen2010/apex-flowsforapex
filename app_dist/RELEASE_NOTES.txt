DOCUMENTATION / SOURCE CODE / FURTHER INFORMATION
- Have a look here: https://github.com/mt-ag/apex-flowsforapex

PREREQUISITES
- Oracle Database 12.2 or higher (all editions supported)
- Oracle Application Express 20.1 or higher
- APEX workspace with at least 50 MB space

INSTALLING THE APPLICATION
- Logon to the APEX workspace
- In the Application Builder, click on "Import"
- Import the application file "FLOWSFORAPEX_EN_APEX201_984339_UTF8_V5.1.0.sql" from "Applications" folder using Unicode UTF-8 as file character set
- Let APEX choose an application ID for you (default)
- When asked to install the supporting objects, select "Yes"
- Optionally, you can now import the demo app in the same way by using file "FLOWSFORAPEXDEMO_EN_APEX201_984340_UTF8_V2.0.sql"
- Optionally, if you want to use timers, execute "grant create job" to your workspace schema as sys first and then execute the script enable_timers.sql in your workspace schema

HISTORY
* v5.1.0
  - Introduces process diagram versioning and lifecycle management
  - Supports diagram import and export to XML or SQL files from the Flows for APEX application
  - Adds process categories to aid management of business processes
  - Enhanced user interface to support versioning and categories
  - Adds plain PL/SQL option for Script Tasks and Service Tasks to allow automated tasks to execute following a timer
  - Fixed bug preventing processes with nested open parallel gateways from completing
  - Fixed bug preventing long duration (months, years) timers from starting
  - Updated bpmn.io libraries
  - Added upgrade support to installation process
  - Hey, we even have our own logo now!

* v5.0.1
  - Enables process variables to be used when specifying timer definitions
  - Fixed bug that rises when reusing an ID across flows
  - Added tutorial Flows for beginners in BPMN 2.0
  - Added pagination on the flow control page
  - Added a Getting Started page
  - When processing timers errors that occur mark respective timer as broken but don't break job anymore
  - Added "Add Gateway Route" to Flow Control for convenience when adding a process variable for a gateway

* v5.0.0
  - Live validation checks during modelling provided by bpmnlint.
  - Support for user tasks: call an APEX page as specified in the properties panel (page ID, app ID, etc.).
  - Support for script tasks: call a PL/SQL procedure as specified in the properties panel.
  - Support for service tasks: send out an e-mail by calling apex_mail as specified in the properties panel.
  - Support for timers (requires a grant on create dbms_job).
  - BPMN Modeler is now wrapped in a plugin. This also removes the limitation of modelling flows that are larger than 32kB.
  - Process variables that live within the scope of a process instance.
  - Updated Demo App “Shipment Processes” that utilizes process variables at gateways.
  - Support for escalation & error boundary events on sub processes and timer boundary events on tasks and user tasks. Timers and escalations can be interrupting or non-interrupting.
  - A new view "flow_processes_vw" that can be used as source for the BPMN viewer plugin.
  - Improved API package: moved internal procedures to a new package ‘flow_engine.pkg’. Flow control now designed for automatic flow between tasks using only a complete_step procedure to replace flow_next_step. The V4.0 syntax of flow_next_step and flow_next_branch now desupported.
  - Gateway routing decision is now automatically made based on a specific process variable.
  - Support for process inbox-style applications through enhanced inbox views, along with optional task reservation. (reserve_task, release_task).

* v4.0.0
  - New Subflow architecture to support Parallel Gateways, Sub Processes
  - Support for subprocesses (n levels deep)
  - Support for Parallel Gateways (AND) and parallel flows, including process re-synchronisation
  - Support for Inclusive Gateways (OR) and optional parallel flows, including process re-synchronisation
  - Support for IntermediateCatchEvents and eventBasedGateways
  - Support for Terminate Stop Events in top level processes
  - Process viewer now shows all present and completed steps, and expanded views of sub-processes
  - Basic support for process lanes
  - PL/SQL API changes to support subflow architecture
  - New demo app "Order Shipment"
  - New Documentation, now also hosted using Github Pages (https://mt-ag.github.io/apex-flowsforapex/)
  - Prototype Lab Features
    - Timed Start Events
    - Timer Intermediate Catch Events

* v3.0.0
  - XML parsing now done using PL/SQL only
  - Upgraded all bpmn.io libraries to 7.2.0
  - Support for subprocesses (one level deep)
  - Fixed minor bugs and adopted coding standards

* v2.0.0
  - Reworked API package
  - Added demo app
  - Checked for coding standards

* v1.0.1
  - Fixed a few bugs
  - Annotations in Flows are now supported

* v1.0
  - Initial Release
